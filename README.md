# onto2vec
## Introduction
Onto2Vec is a program that can be used to produce feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. Onto2Vec uses the integrity of the axioms describing the structure of a medical ontology as well as the entity-concept annotation axioms. 
This is a detailed documentation on how to use Onto2Vec to produce these ontology-based feature vectors.
